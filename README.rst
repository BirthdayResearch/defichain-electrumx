=========================================================
DeFiChain ElectrumX - Reimplementation of electrum-server
=========================================================

  :Licence: MIT
  :Language: Python (>= 3.8)
  :Original Author: Neil Booth

This project is a fork of `spesmilo/electrumx <https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx>`_
with expanded features to work with DeFiChain. Refer to `defichain-electrum <https://github.com/BirthdayResearch/defichain-electrum>`_
for integration.

DeFiChain ElectrumX allows users to run their own DeFiChain Electrum server. It connects to your
full node and indexes the blockchain, allowing efficient querying of the history and DeFiChain
token balance of arbitrary addresses. The server can be exposed publicly, and joined to the public network
of servers via peer discovery.

Documentation
=============

DeFiChain ElectrumX is using identical dependencies as upstream.
See original documentation `readthedocs <https://electrumx-spesmilo.readthedocs.io/>`_ for setup detail.
